### Hi there! 👋

My name is [Gosha](https://gosha.net), and I'm a generalist programmer (among other things). I live and work in London with my partner and our daughter.

I'm currently exploring Common Lisp by building ⚙️ [Homestead](https://github.com/goshatch/homestead), a static site generator I plan to use to build new features for [my website](https://gosha.net), which is currently built using Jekyll. I'm grateful to the people who put together the [Common Lisp Cookbook](https://lispcookbook.github.io/cl-cookbook/)!

I love getting email, and do my best to reply to everyone, so please don't hesitate to email me at `mail@gosha.net`. You can talk to me in English, French, Russian, Japanese, or basic Mandarin Chinese. Thank you!
