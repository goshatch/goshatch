### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

My name is [Gosha](https://gosha.net), and I'm a generalist programmer (among other things). I live and work in London with my partner and our daughter, and these days I'm working on [Parts](https://github.com/apossiblespace/parts), a tool for psychotherapists working in the [Internal Family Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_Family_Systems_Model) modality.

I'm also working on a [Clojure SDK](https://github.com/goshatch/atproto-clojure) for the [AT Protocol](https://atproto.com), which is used by e.g. [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/gosha.net).

I love getting email, and do my best to reply to everyone, so please don't hesitate to email me at `mail@gosha.net`. You can talk to me in English, French, Russian, Japanese, or basic Mandarin Chinese. Thank you!
